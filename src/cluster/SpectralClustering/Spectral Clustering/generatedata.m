function [data, class] = generatedata(nbsamples, nbclasses, dim, dist, details, blackplot)
%nbsamples is used to specify how many data samples to generate
%
%nbclasses is used to specify how many classes to consider when generating
%the data
%
%dim is the dimension of each sample (for graphical representation use dim
%equal to 2)
%
%dist specify how the data are generated:
%'gaussian' means the data will be a gaussian distribution with a certain
%mean and standard deviation. details should be a cell (nbclasses, 2) and
%each row contains first the mean and second the std, and each mean or std
%is a vector of dimension dim
%
%'circles' means the data will be distributed as circles with a certain
%mean which means the center, a radius and a std to express how much points
%will deviate from the radius, details should be a cell (nbclasses, 5) and
%each row contains first the mean of dimension dim, then the radius of
%dimension 1, and std of dimension dim. the fourth detail is:
%'complete' for a whole circle
%'uhalf' for the upper half of the circle
%'lhalf' for the lower half of the circle
%and the fifth detail is the wanted percentage of the circle
%
%details contains in each row informations about the type of distribution
%
%blackplot when set to positive integer means that all data will be plotted
%as black circles if dimension is two (used for unsupervised learning
